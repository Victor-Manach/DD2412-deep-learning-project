# DD2412 Advanced Deep Learning

This project was carried out within the framework of the course DD2412 Advanced Deep Learning at KTH, Stockholm. In this project we aim to reproduce the work described in the paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.06377">Masked Autoencoders Are Scalable Vision Learners</a> with the <a href="https://github.com/google/jax">JAX</a> library in Python.

Additional experiments were conducted, including:
<ul>
<li>Comparison between a model trained purely with the MAE objective and a model that uses a contrastive loss too.</li>
<li>Experiment with new transformer architectures for the encoder and the decoder.</li>
</ul>
